# HollowCry
This was one of my first games developed as part of my programming coursework in Unity. It was a valuable learning experience where I gained a deeper understanding of game mechanics, coding principles, and the Unity engine. Through this project, I was able to apply fundamental programming concepts and explore creative problem-solving techniques. It also provided me with a solid foundation for future game development projects.
